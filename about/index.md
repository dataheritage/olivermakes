## About this site

### Under the hood

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for building.

[Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for hosting.

[S3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) for deploying.

[GitHub](https://github.com/opattison/olivermakes) for version control.

### Design and development

I worked alone on this site for a few weeks in October and November 2014. I would like to thank [Jean](http://jeancflanagan.com) for input.

My process for designing the site mostly involves starting out with a handful of sketches, writing a few notes and then diving into a text editor and browser to get it working.

### Typography

The fonts on the site (300, 400 and 500 weights of [the Ratio typeface](http://cargocollective.com/pstype/Ratio)) are [hosted by Typekit](https://typekit.com/colophons/hro5wuc).

All code is under copyright, but is available to use and borrow from [on GitHub](https://github.com/opattison/olivermakes). If you are looking at the repository, everything in the `_static` and `_posts` folders is CC BY-NC and the rest is under copyright, where applicable. 

I designed the site myself, so most of the code was written by me by hand – exceptions where code is derived from another source are noted inline. An example of copyright violation would be copying the source code outright and using it to make a public website that could be confused for this one.

Proper CC BY-NC attribution with a link and credit would look like this:

Or in HTML:

{% highlight html %}
“The title” <a href="http://olivermak.es”>Oliver Pattison</a> CC BY-NC
{% endhighlight %}

Please [get in touch with me by email](mailto:oliverpattison@gmail.com) if you have any questions about licensing or use of content from the site. **Permission is not required for CC BY-NC content as long as it is properly attributed.** However, if you plan on using any photography for non-commercial purposes, it would be nice to let me know!

## Elsewhere on the web

I post nearly every significant thing I read or look at on the web [on Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:opattison). Pinboard is my favorite web service and is as complete an archive as I can keep of my reading online. Pinboard is my external brain.

You can follow me [on Twitter at olivermakes](http://twitter.com/olivermakes).

My open source code (including this site) is [on GitHub](https://github.com/opattison).

I post a selection of my mobile photography to [VSCO Grid](http://olivermakes.vsco.co).

I post less frequently to:

- [Tumblr](http://olivermakes.tumblr.com)
- [Google Plus](http://plus.google.com/+OliverPattison)
- [Panoramio](http://www.panoramio.com/user/oliverpattison)
