title: .image--narrow
use: 'Images that need to take up the full width of the body but not much more, especially at larger screen sizes. Square or vertically photos are a good use case for this style. Contrast with [.image--wide](#image-wide)'
spec: 'Typically 100% width, but this is somewhat layout-dependent (bleeds edge-to-edge on small screens). Contains an `<img>`. Figcaption is optional.'
