My partner Jean Flanagan and I have a shared interest in self-archiving. Often we write and edit collaboratively. We have worked together on shared photography repositories. So it made sense for us to pool our resources to make Jean a website to feature her writing and photography. Jean would collect and edit her output and I would help her design and develop it.



## Features of the site

### Content first

The first thing we started out with were full-length articles about science, already written and edited. Having content ahead of time meant that the site could be designed around *actual words and images* rather than lorem ipsum filler text. It was essential to the process to test typography and proportion with real content.

### Responsive design with flexible layout

### Large images

### Personality

## Choosing Jekyll

Jean already had a personal WordPress site, which I had helped her transition from the limited WordPress.com service to her own personal domain and host. The problems were limitations in configuration and design. I could certainly help redesign a WordPress site, but it would be an uphill battle since I have not ever made a theme from scratch, and I don’t know much PHP. Building on existing themes was a sure way to end up with a design with compromises and inflexibility.

Both of us realized that WordPress was no longer a good fit. We both wanted more control over the design. Jean wanted more control over content and flexible layouts, as well as an interface that wouldn’t involve fighting with a WYSIWYG editor or administering a content management system and database. The trade-off of ease-of-use and getting started quickly with WordPress was outweighed by a desire to publish independently and to develop a process that would be able to withstand servers misbehaving, databases being corrupted, or any of the pitfalls of locking in to a “platform”.

We chose Jekyll because it would allow for a high performance site with plenty of flexibility in design and configuration. We realized that there would be a learning curve for both of us, since I had only just gotten started with Jekyll and it would be new for Jean. A site built of flat files and no <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr> nor server-side processing is limiting for some applications, but has great advantages in performance and maintainability.

## Getting it right is difficult

Publishing something on the web is relatively easy, but creating something lasting that you won’t want to scrap and rework later can take a significant amount of time and effort. For this project, both design and content were weighed deliberately.



## What I learned from this project

- I learned how to set up a Jekyll site for personal publishing, with processes that would inspire me to create my own site.
- I learned how to use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/opattison/jeancflanagan/issues) to communicate in real time about the process, as well as document the history of the project.
- Working with development environments and version control is essential for a collaborative project, even if only two people are involved and their roles are well-defined.
- Designing for yourself or someone close to you is difficult. This process took months longer than we thought it might initially, but it ended up being worth additional effort to get certain design and content elements done *right*.
