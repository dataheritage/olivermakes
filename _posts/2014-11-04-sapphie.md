  <h2>A new friend</h2>
  <p>On <time datetime="2014-10-06">October 6</time>, <a href="http://jeancflanagan.com">Jean</a> and I met and subsequently adopted a dog. We named her Sapphie after <a href="http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG019">a favorite album of mine by Richard Youngs</a>, which was dedicated to his dog. She is a two-year-old rescue dog from North Carolina who was likely mistreated. She is warm and friendly, and she attached to us so quickly that we are barely able to leave the apartment without her. We hope to help our dog friend with her anxiety while she keeps us in good physical shape and teaches us to be kind to strangers.</p>
