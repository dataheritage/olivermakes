Jekyll is not user-friendly by default. To set it up, you have to have a computer with a command line (Mac or Linux vastly preferred), get set up with Ruby, take care of your own deployment and hosting needs. It also requires a distinct awareness of files and process abstraction that many web developers take for granted. This is “easy” if you already have it set up or have a privileged and (globally speaking) a rare understanding of how computers and the web work.

On the other hand, Jekyll is made up of some simple elements. It processes Markdown and HTML files into a working website with a simple command <samp>$ jekyll build</samp>.
