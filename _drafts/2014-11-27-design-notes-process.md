My process for designing this site began with a handful of sketches and notes. As soon as I had enough to start with, I started work in a text editor and browser and came up with a typographic measure and fundamental ratios. I avoid mockups and high-fidelity compositions in favor of sketching, followed by iterative HTML/CSS prototyping that that I worked into finished code as the project progressed.

When I design for the web, I target small-screens first (commonly known as [“mobile-first”](http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first) implentation), so I make sure to test on a variety of devices as I go along. The first browser width I look at is under `20em` (less than ~320 pixels). Working with fewer assumptions about device types informs the design process; it is easier to design with empathy and flexibility with a responsive and iterative process.

A significant part of my process involved establishing a [pattern page](/patterns) with reference examples of general HTML and specific use cases for my own designs. I plan to expand it and turn it into a pattern library and style guide for the site.
