With so much of my time spent reading on the web on small screens, it is rare that I can appreciate a print artifact. My favorite magazine right now is <i class="title"><a href="https://worksthatwork.com">Works That Work</a></i>, a twice-yearly international publication about design. <i class="title">WTW</i> is different from similar publications that cover technology, design and innovation, but not in the narrower context of mainstream consumer electronics, startups, advertising or web development. <i class="title">WTW</i> deals with the big picture – it focuses on less-often-covered issues such as industrial design, urban landscapes, the aftermath of war, the challenges of poverty, extreme environments, the distant future.

A favorite piece of mine from last year was [“The Box That Shrank the World”](https://worksthatwork.com/2/intermodal-container/share/ed0737fd77a709d94d8bbaf1d5617bb3), an article on the “lowly, inelegant container”. This story explains the quite recent history of how standardization and efficiency, in the form of international shipping containers, led to globalization. A single modular design had an immense and lasting effect on international economics and culture.

<ancillary class="aside">
<p>Nearly as important as the writing and photography, <i class="title">Works That Work</i> gets typography, layout and physical feel of the magazine <em>right</em>. Along with <i class="title"><a href="http://nautil.us">Nautilus</a></i>, their print issues are carefully put together, have great care for reproduction of photo and color. They are something I really look forward to getting in the mail.</p>
<p><i class="title">The New Yorker</i>, one of my only other remaining magazine subscriptions could learn a few lessons from these publications that are printed less frequently, but have much higher standards for printing. After a year or two, most of my 47-per-year print issues of <i class="title">The New Yorker</i> end up in a forgotten pile, lost, or headed for recycling. This is not only an issue of frequency, but of craft. Every year, I question whether I could cut back on the “print” part of other magazine subscriptions, while I look forward to reading <i class="title">WTW</i> both in print and on the web.</p>
