## Goals

- Build a personal website as an archive for my creative output.
- Experiment with HTML, CSS and design patterns that I have not implemented before.
- Showcase my work for friends, colleagues, and potential collaborators and employers.
- Learn more about building advanced static sites with Jekyll.
- Initially, design and implement entirely by myself, with later feedback from others.

## Principles
